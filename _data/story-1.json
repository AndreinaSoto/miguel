    "answer": "King Miguel or Negro Miguel was an enslaved men that led an important insurrection in the valleys of Yaracuy (northwestern Venezuela) in the mid-sixteenth century. His story, recorded in multiple early modern sources, precedes important events that shaped and reshaped the Province of Venezuela over the next decades.  ",

    "layer1_text": "In December 1552, an enslaved man named Miguel, “a brave black, creole from San Juan of Puerto Rico,” led an insurrection against the residents of the city of Nueva Segovia and the mines of Buría in northwestern Venezuela, and founded a  _palenque_ –maroon settlement– that would last until its destruction in April 1553. \n\nThe story “Negro Miguel” or “King Miguel” survives in several chroniclers and _elegías_ written over the following decades by authors like Friar Pedro de Aguado,  Friar Pedro Simón, Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, and Juan de Castellanos who, throughout the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, painted a cautionary tale of the evils of this event. \n\nThese stories portrayed Miguel, as “very ladino in the Castilian tongue and familiar with all kinds of evil,” who sought to kill men, conquer women, and take over the few cities and towns that made up the fledging Province of Venezuela, and perhaps even the neighboring New Kingdom of Granada — at least until the brave Captain Diego de Losada and other Spaniards had vanquished him and put an end to his pretensions. \n\nBut a careful reading of these accounts also provide a few glimpses of the goals and strategies that Miguel implemented in his campaign: from his efforts to garner the support from Jirajara indigenous people and enslaved Black people, planning several attacks against Spanish towns close to Buría and Nueva Segovia, and founding a _palenque_ that spatially cemented their presence as free settlers, to declaring himself king and appointing royal officials. \n\nDespite the limitations and biases in colonial sources, they show that colonial control was hardly reasserted during and after Miguel’s defeat, and that the lands of northwestern Venezuela – particularly between Lara and Yaracuy – would in fact remain contested spaces for generations, undergoing moments of conflict and negotiation, and acting as a mirror of many of the issues of ordering and expansion that shaped Venezuela throughout the seventeenth century.",

    "layer1_text": "Miguel’s insurrection coincided with significant political changes in the administration of the Province of Venezuela, in the mid-1550s, as the government shifted from the _asiento_ granted to the Welsers to what on paper was a more direct Spanish administration. The Welsers, a prominent German banking family, had been given administrative control over Venezuela on March 27, 1528 through a series of _Capitulaciones_ that granted them a monopoly to explore Venezuela, control over the slave trade and mining privileges in exchange for pacifying the province and cementing European control. \n\nBy 1556, when the Welser _asiento_ expired, the monarchy drew up new plans to consolidate the Spanish presence in Venezuela, both by shoring up existing settlements and expanding their occupation inland and by employing new intermediaries directly under their command.\n\nOne of the towns founded during this shifting of power was Nueva Segovia, and its neighboring mine of Buría, from where Miguel would soon lead his insurrection. Damián del Barrio (who owned Miguel) was one of the settlers who scouted the region around El Tocuyo and, after finding traces of gold, founded Nueva Segovia and opened Buría. This effort was another attempt by the Spanish crown to reap the benefits from mining extraction once promised during the Welsers _asiento_, if this time by working with smaller players. As part of this process, Jiraraja people native to this region were put into _encomiendas_ and distributed to the new settlers, so that their labor could be exploited by a new cohort of officials enabled by the Spanish monarchy.",

    "layer1_text": "Overall, the chroniclers attempted to highlight the danger of this insurrection and the dexterity of its opponents in defeating it, progressively crafting slightly different, distorted narratives about what unfolded in Venezuela. However, a careful reading of these accounts reveals a few glimpses of more complex dynamics taking shape during this period.\n\nA key theme in these sources is the strategies that Miguel employed to orchestrate two attacks, one in the mines and one in Nueva Segovia, and his efforts to create alliance with Black enslaved and indigenous Jirajara people to orchestrate the insurrection against Spanish settlers. According to Pedro Simón, who wrote in the 1620s, Miguel ran away to avoid punishment and often went to the mines and Nueva Segovia “to talk to the other slaves and Indians”, seeking to persuade them to do as he did, because they “would find their freedom, which the Spanish had so tyrannically (he said) usurped from them.”(Simón,  _Noticias Historiales,_ 235) Likewise, friars Aguado and Simón retell how Miguel and his men would keep expanding their reach to neighboring areas, orchestrating more attacks with the help of other enslaved people residing in nearby towns and cities, showing the extent of communication and alliances forming among indigenous and Black people under the noses of Spanish masters (Aguado, _Historia de Venezuela_, 380).\n\nMore importantly, these sources provide a glimpse of the motivations and strategies that Miguel and his people employed to achieve freedom and position themselves as _conquistadores_ and creators of a new kingdom, even as they highlight the dangers of their actions.\n\nSoon after the attack on Buría, Miguel and his people established a _palenque_ named Curduvaré in their conquered territories, near the shores of the San Pedro River. The group, which comprised Black and Jirajara people, settled the _palenque_, from which they planned to control access to the mine of Buría. According to Friar Pedro Simón, Miguel and his people fortified the _palenque_ with strong palisades and trenches, with one entrance near the river of San Pedro and the other facing the mounts to make difficult its access, “strong and comfortable for human habitation, fenced, with solid houses since [Miguel] intended to remain in this place from which, according to the Friar, Miguel intended to become the lord of all the land.” (Simón, 235) \n\nThis new settlement would also follow particular social orderings and hierarchies that defied Spanish control. Miguel was crowned King by his followers, named his partner Guiomar –described as either his _manceba_ or his friend— as queen, and his _hijuelo_ as prince.[[1]](#_ftn1) \n\nAccording to the friars accounts, the newly appointed king also established other titles among his subjects, such as “creating all the ministers and officials that he had in memory that there were of the households of the Kings.” The chroniclers also highlighted how Miguel used his “spiritual and temporal power” to name a bishop among one of his partners that he considered most qualified for the tasks, and ordered the construction of a church, where he had “those black as filthy sheep gathered to preach to them” (Aguado, _Historia de Venezuela_, 380). \n\nDespite the attempts to portray Miguel’s kingdom with a negative lens, these accounts also allude to a _palenque_ that, out of the bounds of enslavers and local officials, sought to follow European schemes of social and spatial organization and cement the freedom and power of its own settlers.",

    "layer1_text": "Despite the short span of Miguel Kingdom, the effects of the insurrection had a long-lasting impact.\n\nThe story survived, for example, in colonial chronicles as a cautionary tale and to highlight the heroic actions of the Spanish settlers who fought the insurrection. Chronicles retell how between March and April 1553, Captain Diego Losada led several men from El Tocuyo on foot until reaching the _Palenque_, and “swiftly” managed to dominate the ensuing battle, kill Miguel, and re-enslave some of the survivors, including Guiomar and other women.\n\nBut sources also alluded to the fact that many of the survivors managed to escape captivity and punishment at the hands of their oppressors, hiding in the _montes_ of Yaracuy and continuing the opposition to European expansion, thereby depicting the region of Yaracuy as a contested space (Cf. Juan de Castellanos, _Elegías._).\n\nThe mines of Buría, once a promising spot for gold extraction, were never recovered; meanwhile, efforts to establish other mining sites and new settlements were soon halted by the threat of the Jirajara people and the survivors from Miguel’s kingdom who managed to escape Losada’s attack. \n\nThese accounts also showcase how this event prompted decades of interruption to transit between the cities of Barquisimeto, Valencia, and El Tocuyo, as well as to Spanish attempts to establish communication routes in inland Venezuela, resulting in decades of conflict and tensions that would define much of the century ahead, with threats of violence and alternative normative orders by Black and indigenous people.\n\n---",

    "layer2_text": "Over the following decades, the region continued to oscillate between moments of calm and renewed conflict, leaving colonial authorities in a constant state of alert, often portraying freed and maroon communities as the main source of trouble. The numerous failed attempts to expand Spanish control over this region necessitated the implementation of different strategies. The foundation of Nirgua in the valleys of Yaracuy in 1601 – and once again, in 1628– near areas previously conquered by Miguel, would be a turning point, with colonial authorities outsourcing the effort to people of African descent, naming them _conquistadores_, and granting them privileges that partially formalized their autonomy. This represented a new strategy led by men of African descent: rather than insurrections, this group of freed people, descendants of Black enslaved and indigenous people, would adopt and adapt the imperial ideals of ordering, conquering, and pacification to put forward a plan to take over a contested space."
