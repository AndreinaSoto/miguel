Writing in 1581, Friar Pedro de Aguado, provided a more detailed account about the “_alzamiento de negros”_ in the mines of Nueva Segovia, naming Miguel as the direct responsible of the insurrection that led to the death of Spanish miners who were determined to “expel [Spanish settlers] from their town [of Nueva Segovia] and give them cruel deaths, taking their women to their own service.”[[1]](#_ftn1)
