Writing in 1581, Friar Pedro de Aguado, provided a more detailed account about the “_alzamiento de negros”_ in the mines of Nueva Segovia, naming Miguel as the direct responsible of the insurrection that led to the death of Spanish miners who were determined to “expel [Spanish settlers] from their town [of Nueva Segovia] and give them cruel deaths, taking their women to their own service.”[[1]](#_ftn1)

In the 1600s, Antonio Herrera de Tordesillas, published his _Historia General_ with an entry the _negros_ of Santa Marta and Venezuela, and explained that the significant number of black people lived in these areas “with so much carelessness, and little modesty” that a small group of slaves, out of their “natural and rustic pride” sought to escape slavery “thinking they could live among the Indians.”[[2]](#_ftn2)
