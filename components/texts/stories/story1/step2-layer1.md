Miguelâ€™s insurrection coincided with significant political changes in the administration of the Province of Venezuela, in the mid-1550s, as the government shifted from the _asiento_ granted to the Welsers to what on paper was a more direct Spanish administration. The Welsers, a prominent German banking family, had been given administrative control over Venezuela on March 27, 1528 through a series of _Capitulaciones_ that granted them a monopoly to explore Venezuela, control over the slave trade and mining privileges in exchange for pacifying the province and cementing European control. 

By 1556, when the Welser _asiento_ expired, the monarchy drew up new plans to consolidate the Spanish presence in Venezuela, both by shoring up existing settlements and expanding their occupation inland and by employing new intermediaries directly under their command.
