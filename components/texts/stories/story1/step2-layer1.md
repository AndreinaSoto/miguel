Miguel’s insurrection coincided with significant political changes in the administration of the Province of Venezuela, in the mid-1550s, as the government shifted from the _asiento_ granted to the Welsers to what on paper was a more direct Spanish administration. The Welsers, a prominent German banking family, had been given administrative control over Venezuela on March 27, 1528 through a series of _Capitulaciones_ that granted them a monopoly to explore Venezuela, control over the slave trade and mining privileges in exchange for pacifying the province and cementing European control. 

By 1556, when the Welser _asiento_ expired, the monarchy drew up new plans to consolidate the Spanish presence in Venezuela, both by shoring up existing settlements and expanding their occupation inland and by employing new intermediaries directly under their command.

One of the towns founded during this shifting of power was Nueva Segovia, and its neighboring mine of Buría, from where Miguel would soon lead his insurrection. Damián del Barrio (who owned Miguel) was one of the settlers who scouted the region around El Tocuyo and, after finding traces of gold, founded Nueva Segovia and opened Buría. This effort was another attempt by the Spanish crown to reap the benefits from mining extraction once promised during the Welsers _asiento_, if this time by working with smaller players. As part of this process, Jiraraja people native to this region were put into _encomiendas_ and distributed to the new settlers, so that their labor could be exploited by a new cohort of officials enabled by the Spanish monarchy.
