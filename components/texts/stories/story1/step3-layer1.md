First considered a promising spot for extracting rich metals, Buría would soon become a critical zone of resistance and contention, where indigenous and Black people would defy European orderings and set up their own normative order — at least for a few generations. 

Records of the events that unfolded during this insurrection consist of scattered fragments and recollections by people involved, which were shaped into and narratives by different authors, officers, and chroniclers, such as Juan de Castellanos, Friar Pedro de Aguado, Friar Pedro Simón and Antonio Herrera y Tordesillas, and which provide varied –distorted— glimpses into the nature of the insurrection and its leader.

An anonymous _relación_ from the late sixteenth century narrated this event as one of the latest misadventures of the Welsers _asiento_ in Venezuela, stating that 250 blacks ran away to Nueva Segovia “to kill the Christians, and split the women of the Christians among them.”[[1]](#_ftn1)
