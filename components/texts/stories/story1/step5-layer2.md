But sources also alluded to the fact that many of the survivors managed to escape captivity and punishment at the hands of their oppressors, hiding in the _montes_ of Yaracuy and continuing the opposition to European expansion, thereby depicting the region of Yaracuy as a contested space.

The mines of Buría, once a promising spot for gold extraction, were never recovered; meanwhile, efforts to establish other mining sites and new settlements were soon halted by the threat of the Jirajara people and the survivors from Miguel’s kingdom who managed to escape Losada’s attack. 

These accounts also showcase how this event prompted decades of interruption to transit between the cities of Barquisimeto, Valencia, and El Tocuyo, as well as to Spanish attempts to establish communication routes in inland Venezuela, resulting in decades of conflict and tensions that would define much of the century ahead, with threats of violence and alternative normative orders by Black and indigenous people.

The numerous failed attempts to expand Spanish control over this region necessitated the implementation of different strategies. **A key moment was the foundation of Nirgua in the valleys of Yaracuy in 1601 – and once again, in 1628– near areas previously conquered by Miguel, would be a turning point, with colonial authorities outsourcing the effort to people of African descent, naming them *conquistadores*, and granting them privileges that partially formalized their autonomy.** 

This represented a new strategy led by men of African descent: rather than insurrections, this group of freed people, descendants of Black enslaved and indigenous people, would adopt and adapt the imperial ideals of ordering, conquering, and pacification to put forward a plan to take over a contested space.
