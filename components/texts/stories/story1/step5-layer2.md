title: The aftermath of Miguel's Kingdom
---

Over the following decades, the region continued to oscillate between moments of calm and renewed conflict, leaving colonial authorities in a constant state of alert, often portraying freed and maroon communities as the main source of trouble. The numerous failed attempts to expand Spanish control over this region necessitated the implementation of different strategies. The foundation of Nirgua in the valleys of Yaracuy in 1601 – and once again, in 1628– near areas previously conquered by Miguel, would be a turning point, with colonial authorities outsourcing the effort to people of African descent, naming them _conquistadores_, and granting them privileges that partially formalized their autonomy. This represented a new strategy led by men of African descent: rather than insurrections, this group of freed people, descendants of Black enslaved and indigenous people, would adopt and adapt the imperial ideals of ordering, conquering, and pacification to put forward a plan to take over a contested space.
