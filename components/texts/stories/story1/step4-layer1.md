title: What else can we learn about the people leading the insurrection?
---

Overall, the chroniclers attempted to highlight the danger of this insurrection and the dexterity of its opponents in defeating it, progressively crafting slightly different, distorted narratives about what unfolded in Venezuela. However, **a careful reading of these accounts reveals a few glimpses of more complex dynamics taking shape during this period.**

**A key theme in these sources is the strategies that Miguel employed to orchestrate two attacks,** one in the mines and one in Nueva Segovia, and his efforts to create an alliance with Black enslaved and indigenous Jirajara people to orchestrate the insurrection against Spanish settlers. According to Pedro Simón, who wrote in the 1620s, Miguel ran away to avoid punishment. He often went to the mines and Nueva Segovia “to talk to the other slaves and Indians”, seeking to persuade them to do as he did, because they “would find their freedom, which the Spanish had so tyrannically (he said) usurped from them.”[[1]](#_ftn1).

Likewise, friars Aguado and Simón retell how Miguel and his men would keep expanding their reach to neighboring areas, orchestrating more attacks with the help of other enslaved people residing in nearby towns and cities, showing the extent of communication and alliances forming among indigenous and Black people under the noses of Spanish masters.[[2]](#_ftn2)

More importantly, **these sources provide a glimpse of the motivations and strategies Miguel and his people employed to achieve freedom and position themselves as *conquistadores* and creators of a new kingdom, even if to highlight the dangers of their actions.**

**Soon after the attack on Buría, Miguel and his people established a *palenque* named Curduvaré in their conquered territories, near the shores of the San Pedro River. The group, which comprised Black and Jirajara people, settled the *palenque*,from which they planned to control access to the mine of Buría.** According to Friar Pedro Simón, Miguel and his people fortified the *palenque* with strong palisades and trenches, with one entrance near the river of San Pedro and the other facing the mounts to make difficult its access, “strong and comfortable for human habitation, fenced, with solid houses since [Miguel] intended to remain in this place from which, according to the Friar, Miguel intended to become the lord of all the land.”[[1]](#_ftn1)

**These accounts also allude to a *palenque* that, out of the bounds of enslavers and local officials, sought to follow European schemes of social and spatial organization and cement the freedom and power of its own settlers.** This new settlement would also follow particular social orderings and hierarchies that defied Spanish control. Miguel was crowned King by his followers, named his partner Guiomar –described as either his _manceba_ or his friend— as queen, and his _hijuelo_ as prince.[[1]](#_ftn1). According to the friars' accounts, the newly appointed king also established other titles among his subjects, such as “creating all the ministers and officials that he had in memory that there were of the households of the Kings.” The chroniclers also highlighted how Miguel used his “spiritual and temporal power” to name a bishop among one of his partners that he considered most qualified for the tasks, and ordered the construction of a church, where he had “those black as filthy sheep gathered to preach to them.”[[2]](#_ftn2)
