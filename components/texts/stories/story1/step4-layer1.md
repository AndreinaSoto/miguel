title: What else can we learn about the people leading the insurrection?
---

Overall, the chroniclers attempted to highlight the danger of this insurrection and the dexterity of its opponents in defeating it, progressively crafting slightly different, distorted narratives about what unfolded in Venezuela. However, **a careful reading of these accounts reveals a few glimpses of more complex dynamics taking shape during this period.**

**A key theme in these sources is the strategies that Miguel employed to orchestrate two attacks,** one in the mines and one in Nueva Segovia, and his efforts to create an alliance with Black enslaved and indigenous Jirajara people to orchestrate the insurrection against Spanish settlers. According to Pedro Simón, who wrote in the 1620s, Miguel ran away to avoid punishment. He often went to the mines and Nueva Segovia “to talk to the other slaves and Indians”, seeking to persuade them to do as he did, because they “would find their freedom, which the Spanish had so tyrannically (he said) usurped from them.”[[1]](#_ftn1).

Likewise, friars Aguado and Simón retell how Miguel and his men would keep expanding their reach to neighboring areas, orchestrating more attacks with the help of other enslaved people residing in nearby towns and cities, showing the extent of communication and alliances forming among indigenous and Black people under the noses of Spanish masters.[[2]](#_ftn2)
