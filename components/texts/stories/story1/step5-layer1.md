title: The aftermath of Miguel's Kingdom
---

**Despite the short span of Miguel's Kingdom, the effects of the insurrection seemed to have a long-lasting effect.**

The story survived in colonial chronicles as a cautionary tale and to highlight the heroic actions of the Spanish settlers who fought the insurrection. Chronicles retell how between March and April 1553, Captain Diego Losada led several men from El Tocuyo on foot until reaching the _Palenque_, and “swiftly” managed to dominate the ensuing battle, kill Miguel, and re-enslave some of the survivors, including Guiomar and other women.

These accounts also showcase how this event prompted decades of interruption to transit between the cities of Barquisimeto, Valencia, and El Tocuyo, as well as to Spanish attempts to establish communication routes in inland Venezuela, resulting in decades of conflict and tensions that would define much of the century ahead, with threats of violence and alternative normative orders by Black and indigenous people.

The mines of Buría, once a promising spot for gold extraction, were never recovered; meanwhile, efforts to establish other mining sites and new settlements were soon halted by the threat of the Jirajara people and the survivors from Miguel’s kingdom who managed to escape Losada’s attack.
