title: The story of King Miguel
---

In December 1552, an enslaved man named Miguel, “a brave black, creole from San Juan of Puerto Rico,” led an insurrection against the residents of the city of Nueva Segovia and the mines of Buría in northwestern Venezuela, and founded a  _palenque_ –maroon settlement– that would last until its destruction in April 1553.

The story “Negro Miguel” or “King Miguel” survives in several chroniclers and _elegías_ written over the following decades by authors like Friar Pedro de Aguado,  Friar Pedro Simón, Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, and Juan de Castellanos who, throughout the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, painted a cautionary tale of the evils of this event. 

These stories portrayed Miguel, as “very ladino in the Castilian tongue and familiar with all kinds of evil,” who sought to kill men, conquer women, and take over the few cities and towns that made up the fledging Province of Venezuela, and perhaps even the neighboring New Kingdom of Granada — at least until the brave Captain Diego de Losada and other Spaniards had vanquished him and put an end to his pretensions. 

**But a careful reading of these accounts also provide a few glimpses of the goals and strategies that Miguel implemented in his campaign: from his efforts to garner the support from Jirajara indigenous people and enslaved Black people, planning several attacks against Spanish towns close to Buría and Nueva Segovia, and founding a _palenque_ that spatially cemented their presence as free settlers, to declaring himself king and appointing royal officials.** 

Despite the limitations and biases in colonial sources, they show that colonial control was hardly reasserted during and after Miguel’s defeat, and that the lands of northwestern Venezuela – particularly between Lara and Yaracuy – would in fact remain contested spaces for generations, undergoing moments of conflict and negotiation, and acting as a mirror of many of the issues of ordering and expansion that shaped Venezuela throughout the seventeenth century.
